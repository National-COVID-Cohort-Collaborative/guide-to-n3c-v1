# guide-to-n3c-v1 redirect
This repository exists solely to redirect https://national-covid-cohort-collaborative.github.io/guide-to-n3c-v1/ to its proper home at https://national-clinical-cohort-collaborative.github.io/guide-to-n3c-v1/

Background: The Researcher's Guide to N3C was originally published as a GitHub pages deployment of a repository hosted within the National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative GitHub organization. This organization was renamed to National-Clinical-Cohort-Collaborative, and while the URL was successfully updated to https://national-clinical-cohort-collaborative.github.io/guide-to-n3c-v1/, many had bookmarked the original https://national-covid-cohort-collaborative.github.io/guide-to-n3c-v1/ URL. This organization and repository exist to act as a redirect.

The real source repo exists at https://github.com/national-clinical-cohort-collaborative/guide-to-n3c-v1, and this repo was configured using the guidance at https://dev.to/steveblue/setup-a-redirect-on-github-pages-1ok7.
